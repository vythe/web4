page one: list of sessions (taken slots, open slots, connect idle), new session, quick start
	* can't see any agent keys from the list of sessions
	* click on an open slot to create a client registration, grab the monster/hero and open the field page
	* click on "view" to create a client registration, connect without a mob, open the field page
	* "i know the key" - enter the client key and connect to that client session
	
page two : session control. You need the session key for that
	* mobs do not need client keys as such, but even a server-hosted bot wants the key to mark the mob as controlled
	and to restore the link after a disconnect;
	* the list of mobs with their keys and controller names (the hero is also a mob, right?);
	* a button to create a new client session and attach a bot, or no bot;
	* you can create a new client for a mob that is alread controlled - that will kick the controlling user out;
	* when we have real users, there will be invites to send the generated key to a user;
	* start/stop the engine
	* might have a view-only field view, since we need to read updates anyway
page three: the field
	*  (no session controls)
	* pause button (monsters can pause, too)	
	* leave button (the session will pause)
